# Exploring Weather Trends

Project 1 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

Analysis of local and global temperature data, and comparison of temperature trends where I live with global trends in global temperature.


## Files

- `temperatures_global_rio.py`: script that generates and displays the graph.
- `temperatures_global.sql`: query of global temperatures in the last 100 years.
- `city_list.sql`: query of cities in Brazil.
- `temperatures_Rio.sql`: query of temperatures in the city of Rio de Janeiro in the last 100 years.
- `Temperature_Global.csv`: generated from temperatures_global.sql.
- `Temperature_Rio_de_Janeiro.csv`: generated from temperatures_Rio.sql.
- `temperaturesPerYears.png`: generated from temperatures_global_rio.py.
- `Udacity - Exploring Weather Trends.pdf`: report.


## Dataset

The data were extracted from a workspace present on the course platform. The datasets are in the files `Temperature_Global.csv` and` Temperature_Rio_de_Janeiro.csv`.


## Summary of Findings

Conclusions about global and city temperatures in Rio de Janeiro over the past 100 years:

- The general trend for both temperatures is to increase gradually over the years, and in the last 20 years they have increased at a higher rate.
- The city of Rio de Janeiro has much higher temperatures than the global ones during the whole time analyzed.
- The difference between the temperatures of the city of Rio de Janeiro and the global remains consistent until 20 years ago, when it decreased a little even with the increase of both.
- The trend is that global temperatures will not reach the temperature of the city of Rio de Janeiro even in the coming centuries, except that there is some extreme climatic phenomenon of global magnitude.
